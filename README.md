# proj_ml_clustering

The repository has one jupiter notebook called clustering_experiment which contains the work for parts 1-5 of this project. 

It also contains a doc file named Report which has the report from part 7, as well as the data visualization from part 6. There is also a pdf version of Report with the same content. And since everything in the Report are just pictures, there are the 8 svg files for the word cluster as well as the picture for the map.
